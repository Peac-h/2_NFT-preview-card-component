# Project 2 - Frontend Mentor Challenge - NFT preview card component

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U).

This NFT preview component is one of the easy challenges, intended for newbie coders and this is **my second project** to build on my own.

The only difference between the solution and given references is the media query part. No single media query was actually necessary, but I added few, as I had the knowledge already.
